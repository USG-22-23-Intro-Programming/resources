# Name: ___________

# Read the questions below carefully. Each question describes a
# method that you will need to define with code. In order to demonstrate
# that your method works and test your code, you will need to 'un-comment'
# the method call in the main() method


# 1. Define a method which takes in one integer as a parameter variable.
# This method should print a countdown of the integers from the integer
# itself to the number 1, each print decreasing the value by 1.
def countdown():


# 2. Define a method which asks the user to input a name.
# This method should determine if the name starts with 'Mr.' or 'Ms.'
# If it does, the method should print out 'Hello, ' followed by the name
# If it does not, the method should print out 'What's up?'
def teacherTalk():
    

def main():

    #countdown(5)
    #countdown(12)

    #teacherTalk()
    #teacherTalk()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
